    <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
    <p>
      Arty was created by a Microsoft Certified Expert with over 5 years of experience working in the MSP/Tech industry, 
      specializing in Endpoint Management and Security for major Australian companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      After witnessing firsthand the growing gap in L2 support, customer service, and call center staffing, the mission became clear:
      design an AI assistant that could watch, learn, and do the work — all without needing breaks, salaries, or hand-holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arty helps businesses improve profitability by handling real work for less than the cost of a single human hire — and doing it better.
